COVFEFE (Conditionally Orthogonal Vertices For Edge Filtering in Epidemics) •
コヴフェフェ is a cutting-edge algorithm designed to refine large-scale
molecular transmission networks by identifying and eliminating spurious edges.
By leveraging conditional independence tests rooted in phylogenetics, COVFEFE
offers a computationally scalable solution for enhancing the accuracy of
inferred epidemiological networks.
